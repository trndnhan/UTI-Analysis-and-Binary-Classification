# UTI-Analysis-and-Binary-Classification
Welcome to my repository! This is the repository for my first ever 1-member-only project built (almost) completely from scratch!

**This whole project description in a nutshell**: An Urinalysis Test Results data was collected, preprocessed, analyzed and several ML models were deployed.

There are some files/folders that you will want to look at (or not):
- **'data' folder**: Contains data used throughout this project. Including: 'urinalysis_tests.csv' - the uncleaned data, 'cleaned_urinalysis_tests.csv' - the cleaned data, 'transformed_urinalysis_tests.csv' - the transformed data for ML models deployment, and 'models.csv' - the metrics of the deployed ML models.
- **'notebooks' folder**: Where the magic happens! There are 5 notebooks in total, and the name of each kinda explains what is in that notebook. **IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE CODES, PLEASE DIG INTO THIS FOLDER.**
- **'REPORT.pdf' file**: A documentation of what I did in the notebooks and all my findings. This file only contains the most crucial information about the project, not every code block was included to avoid making the document too long and redundant. **IF YOU ONLY WANT TO SEE THE INSIGHTS OF THE PROJECT, PLEASE READ THIS FILE.**

**ONE MORE THING.** If you view the notebooks on Github and feel like they are too long, please view the Colab version of the notebook (there is a 'Open in Colab' at the top of each notebook, click it!).
